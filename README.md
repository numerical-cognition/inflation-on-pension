# inflation-on-pension

To calculate inflation on pension, copy the text from the file (either file, choose language that you want), and paste it in a browser console.

To open up a browser console press `F12`.

After you copied the text there press `ctrl` + `enter`. That should run the function and give you back all required information.

To change the parameters of the function follow the following guidelines:

`pension(starting_salary, working_experience, salary_increase_per_year, inflation_rate)`

## Example

pension(5000, 40, 0.01, 0.02);

- 5000 refers to the base salary (salary that you earn per month)
- 40 refers to the years that you work before you retire
- 0.01 refers to salary increase per year (this here means 1% increase in salary per year)
- 0.02 refers to inflation rate per year (this here means 2% inflation per year)
